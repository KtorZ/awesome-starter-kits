# Ogmios TypeScript Client Starter Kit

This starter kit provides a NodeJS package with several examples of how to leverage Ogmios Typescript client to execute local-state-queries, local-chain-sync and local-tx-submission and local-tx-monitoring protocols against a node.

While Ogmios offers a language-agnostic API, this kit utilizes the TypeScript client that is available for Ogmios. Clients exist in other languages such as Kotlin, Go or Java.
